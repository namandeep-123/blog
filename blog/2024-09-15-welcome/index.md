**Welcome to my blog I'm Naman and here I document my latest explorations.**

<!-- truncate -->

Hey there, I'm a backend developer passionate about building systems that scale. Through this blog, I aim to share insights, tips, and best practices that I’ve learned along the way, helping you tackle challenges in backend development.

I may still be growing in this field, but I believe every experience has something to offer. Whether you're just starting or looking to refine your skills, I’m confident that the topics I cover here—ranging from system architecture to database optimization—will offer value to your journey as well.

### _About Me_

I'm a Software Developer Engineer at **Refyne**. My experience in technology has been pretty varied; I've worked on SaaS products as well as e-commerce platforms. My background includes working with frontend and backend development.

Prior to joining Refyne, I was a co-founder of **PetScoob**, a pet care platform, where I oversaw the MERN stack's development for the entire website and backend infrastructure. I made sure the platform was not only functional but also user-friendly by designing pet service booking systems, connecting APIs, and generating a seamless user experience.

Additionally, I've had the chance to work with **Springworks**, where I improved my backend architecture and cloud services skills, and Fasthr AI, where I helped construct a microservices-based SaaS platform for the hiring process.

I've developed into an Engineer that loves creating products that make people's lives easier as a result of all these experiences. I enjoy travelling to new locations, watching sitcoms and anime, and experimenting with new technology while I'm not at work.
